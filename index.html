	·.★·.·´¯`·.·★ Former Padawan of the Jedi Temple, survivor of Order 66 and then joined the Rebellion as I became a target of the Empire. I've spent my whole life fighting and protecting people, and recently made the acquaintance of Din Djarin, a Mandalorian, and Grogu (that comes from master Yoda's species!) ★·.·´¯`·.·★.· </p>

	<h2>Lightsabers </h2> </div>
<div class="words-box">	
	<p>
		Lightsabers are made of four key components: an emitter, one or two sleeves, a switch and a pommel. They are powered by a kyber crystal, obtained by the young Padawans on the sacred planet of Ilum.
		I am lucky enough to own two of those lightsabers, that match my fighting style in battle. They used to be green, then blue, and they're now white. 
		Why white, you may ask? Well, that's because I no longer belong to the Jedi Order. Therefore, owning white lightsabers symbolizes independance and purity.

	<h2>Force </h2> </div>
<div class="words-box">	
	<p>
		The Force is a mysterious and magical energy field generated by all beings and nature elements, that connects the entire galaxy. The Force lies in every single one of those, and yet only a few beings are born with the ability to sense and control it. They are therefore sensed by Jedi Masters that will come find them, in order to give them training and allow them to learn how to master the Force.
		I was brought to the Jedi Order when I was only three years old. Today, the Force fills my body as if it was my blood. I feel it in me and it'll never leave me.

	<h2> Feelings </h2> </div>
<div class="words-box">	
	<p>
		A Jedi is strongly advised not to develop feelings. Attachment, love, are feelings that can both embellish one's life, and lead it to destruction. Here's a sentence every Jedi knows and teaches: 

		"Fear is the path to the dark side. Fear leads to anger. Anger leads to hate. Hate leads to suffering."

		I've always known this too. And, yet, since I chose to leave the Jedi Order, I have gained emotional freedom. I'll, of course, never forget what I was taught since I strongly believe in it, but at least I'm not being restrained by any other person than myself.

	<h2>Traveling through the universe</h2> </div>
<div class="words-box">	
	<p>
		I am a fierce pilot. I've been taught how to fly ships ever since I became a Padawan. Here's an example of a ship I flew: the fabulous and memorable Delta-7B Jedi Starfighter.
		Thanks to this skill, I have traveled all accross the galaxy and discovered an uncountable quantity of planets and civilisations.

	<h2>Shili </h2> </div>
<div class="words-box">	
	<p>
		Shili is my home planet. It's the homeworld of my species, the Togrutas. Most Togrutas never leave Shili for their entire life, hence you can find a very dense population there. It is located in the Ehosiq sector.
